  <p>This is the best recipe I've ever made for baked potato soup. It's so hearty and comforting that I serve it with just a salad. Everyone in my family loves it!</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>9 baking potatoes</li>
    <li>⅔ cup butter</li>
    <li>⅔ cup all-purpose flour</li>

    <li>½ tablespoon salt</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>

  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
    <li>Prick potatoes with a fork and cook in the microwave, 3 or 4 at a time, until fork-tender, about 7 to 8 minutes. When cool enough to handle, scoop out the flesh.</li>
